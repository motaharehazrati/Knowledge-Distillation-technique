# Knowledge-Distillation-technique
n this experiment, we employed the Knowledge Distillation technique to train a smaller model using a larger pre-trained model, following these sequential steps:

We began with a ResNet50 model, pre-trained on the ImageNet dataset. To adapt it for the CIFAR-10 problem, we replaced its final fully connected layer with one of an appropriate size. The parameters of the network remained constant, with only the final layer being trained and evaluated on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

Next, we trained a ResNet18 model from scratch on CIFAR-10. In parallel, we trained another ResNet18 model from scratch without utilizing a pre-trained model.

To gauge the effectiveness of the Knowledge Distillation technique, we used the pre-trained ResNet50 model as a 'teacher' to guide the training of the ResNet18 model. During this process, we incorporated the distillation parameters α and τ.

The difference in performance between the ResNet18 model trained with Knowledge Distillation and the ResNet18 model trained from scratch can be attributed to several factors.

When applying Knowledge Distillation, the pre-trained ResNet50 model serves as a teacher, imparting its knowledge to the ResNet18 model during training. Consequently, the ResNet18 model benefits from the wealth of experience embedded in the pre-trained model, leading to more efficient learning. This often results in enhanced generalization and improved accuracy compared to training the ResNet18 model from scratch.

Conversely, when training the ResNet18 model from scratch, it must acquire all knowledge from the ground up, devoid of any prior information transfer. This demands a substantial amount of data and computational resources and may entail a lengthier learning curve to attain satisfactory performance. Consequently, the performance of the ResNet18 model trained from scratch may not match that of the model trained via Knowledge Distillation.

In summary, Knowledge Distillation proves to be an effective strategy for enhancing the performance of smaller models, leveraging the valuable insights acquired by a larger pre-trained model
